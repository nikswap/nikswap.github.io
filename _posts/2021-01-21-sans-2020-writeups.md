# Objective 4
## Operate the Santavator
### Objective text:
Talk to Pepper Minstix in the entryway to get some hints about the Santavator.

There is more than one way to solve this. One way is to find all the items scattered across the castle. Another way is to do a bit of browser magic.

### Solutions:
Using the first method can it be a good idea to disable other players to make it easier to spot the stuff.

Another way is to use the javascript console in the browser.

First stop the simulation by overwriting the render function:
{%highlight javascript%}
render = undefined
{%endhighlight%}
Then power on all buttons:
{%highlight javascript%}
document.querySelectorAll('button').forEach(function (b) { console.log(b); b.classList += ' powered'})
{%endhighlight%}
Add the workshop button
{%highlight javascript%}
tokens.push("workshop-button")
btn15img.classList.add('found');
{%endhighlight%}
Last add yourself to be santa at all times:
{%highlight javascript%}
tokens.push('besanta')
{%endhighlight%}

Now you can use all buttons.
